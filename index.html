       <p>"Back in the day, I remember our old club captain said he didn't like the team motto. I've always liked it, but now I feel like I'm finally 'gettin' it'. In volleyball, the past is gone. 
        There ain't no such thing as memories. All you need is right here. All I need... are my muscles!"</p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Atsumu lives in Hyogo prefecture, and thus speaks in a Kansai dialect.
        The twins have been playing volleyball since their elementary school days.
        They attented a volleyball workshop with another one of their teammates - Ojiro Aran.
        During the workshop, Atsumu witnessed personally how a skilled setter brought out the potential of their spikers by sending them the best tosses. 
        This piqued his interest in becoming a setter. 
        At first, Osamu was picked as the setter due to being more skillful. 
        However, according to Aran, Atsumu is said to have an irrepressible hunger as he pushes himself to improve. 
        Eventually, Atsumu overtook Osamu as the official setter of the team.</p>

        <!-- Characteristics -->
        <h2>Personality and Characteristics</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Outwardly, Atsumu appears to be a carefree, confident person who's usually seen with a lazy smile on his face, though he enjoys provoking people and giving offhand compliments. He can be quite condescending, and somewhat selfish at times.</li>
            <li>He also appears to be a perfectionist who has ridiculously high standards for himself and his spikers. He strives to provide the best toss for his spikers, but in turn, expects the spikers to perform at a high standard. 
            If the spikers fail to meet his standards, Atsumu is not afraid to confront them directly and even call them trash, including his own twin brother.</li>
            <li>He has great consideration towards his spikers, as he always tries to deliver the best set as seen during their match with Karasuno 
            when he manages to lunge low enough that he would be able to get under the ball and set with both hands, rather than doing an underhand set. 
            This move caught the attention of several present setters and Ukai even applauded the maneuver while wondering how many of people watching actually realized how incredible Atsumu's set was. </li>

            <p>"Well, with a dig all you've got is two arms. But going overhand means you've got ten fingers to use. Ten is more than two. More support is better, so I went overhand. Cuz I'm a setter."</p>
            <li>He is extremely sensitive when it comes to serving and how much noise is around him; if he's disturbed while serving, his outward personality changes completely and he becomes intimidatingly angry towards the disturbance.</li>
            <li>He is recognized as the number one high school setter, as well as receiving the Best Server award during middle school and the Interhigh.</li>

            <li>Due to his top-notched skills, Atsumu is one of the few players invited to the All-Japan Youth training camp.</li>
            <li>He and Osamu are considered "THE BEST TWINS IN HIGH SCHOOL VOLLEYBALL" </li>

            <li>Like Kageyama and Hinata, he is capable of perfectly coordinating with his twin brother Osamu in pulling off the God-Like Quick. 
            However, his toss is not as accurate as Kageyama's version due to executing the attack without prior practice.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <!-- Skills -->
        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <img src="hero-website/atsumu_skills.jpg">
        <ul>
            <li>Spike Serve and Jump Floater: Atsumu is known as the "Dual Wielder" for his mastery of both the spike serve and jump floater. His spike serve is packed with power while his floaters are fast and unpredictable. This makes it incredibly hard for his opponents since they won't know which type to prepare for until the last minute. 
            However, Atsumu has some peculiar habits regarding his serves in which he takes 4 steps from the end line for a jump floater and 6 steps for a spike serve. He also requires absolute silence during his serve or else risks losing his concentration.</li>
            <li>Hybrid Serve: After observing Russian volleyball player Mikhail Orlov, Atsumu successfully adds a third type of serve to his repertoire and evolves into a "Tri Wielder".
            His hybrid serve uses the same toss and number of steps as a jump floater but is packed with the intense spin of a spike serve. With three serves in his arsenal, Atsumu is able to trick opposing defenders into positioning themselves incorrectly and thus making receiving any of his serves incredibly difficult.</li>
            <li>High-Quality Tosses: Kageyama has described Atsumu's toss to be incredibly easy to hit, thus creating the impression that the spikers have improved. Atsumu is extremely dedicated to providing the best toss for his spikers and would try to use an overhand toss even in difficult positions. 
            An example is when Atsumu gets into a crouched position while tossing overhand with the same speed and fluidity. Due to this, Kenma has described him as the "prototypical setter." His talent as a setter is so immense that he can mimic Kageyama's toss for the minus-tempo quick on the spot.</li>
            <li>Minus-Tempo Quick Set: Like Kageyama, Atsumu is capable of making use of the Freak Quick with either his twin Osamu or with Hinata when they became teammates post-timeskip. While he misses the toss more often than Kageyama does, he has enough precision and speed in his tosses to make full use of the quick.</li>
            <li>Sharp Game Sense:  In addition to his ability to make the best use of his spikers, Atsumu is an expert on pressuring his opponents. He doesn't hesitate to copy Kageyama and Hinata's signature quick to shake Karasuno up. He is also very observant and figures out Kageyama's tendency to toss to Hinata after a botched receive.</li>
            <li>Dump Shot Feint: Atsumu can bait his opponents into a foul by pretending to do a dump shot before switching to set up for a toss. This relies on the rule forbidding the blockers to reach over the net for the ball unless it's an offensive play. Atsumu is seen using this trick to gain an advantage in battles at the edge of the net.</li>
        </ul>
